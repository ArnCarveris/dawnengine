Dawn Engine
===========

A game engine written in C++ designed for powering space games which require galactic sized game worlds to millimetre precision. I've worked on this as my own project for a number of years to learn about game engine design, so some decision decisions are a bit dumb and are in the process of eventually being refactored.
